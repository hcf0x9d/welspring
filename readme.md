# Welcome to the Welspring

The **Welspring** is a labor of love of mine. This project has been in process
for about a decade now, and I'm hoping that my current skillset will make this
project actually launch this time.

This project is a work in progress.

## 30,000 foot view

We are creating an online resource for the PNW WELS/ELS members to share information
about their companies, find local churches, Lutheran schools, et cetera.

There are many ideas and over the coming months, more will get filled out in this
readme.  I will also be attaching my roadmap to this as well in the coming days.

#### As with all of God's Kingdom, this project is open-source.

TODO: Fill out the readme a bit.
