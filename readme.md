# Welcome to the Welspring

The **Welspring** is a labor of love of mine. This project has been in process
for about a decade now, and I'm hoping that my current skillset will make this
project actually lauch this time.

This project is a work in progress.

#### As with all of God's Kingdom, this project is open-source.
